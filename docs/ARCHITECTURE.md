## Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **UI Library**: Material-UI
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **Internationalization**: i18next
- **State Management**: React Hooks

## Design Patterns

### Component Architecture

1. **Functional Components**
   - All components are written as functional components
   - Use React Hooks for state management
   - Props are strictly typed with TypeScript interfaces

2. **Component Organization**
   - Components are organized by feature and reusability
   - Common components are placed in the `components/common` directory
   - Feature-specific components are placed in `components/features`

### State Management

1. **Local State**
   - Use `useState` for component-level state
   - Use `useReducer` for complex state logic

2. **Global State**
   - Context API for global state management
   - Custom hooks for reusable state logic

### Styling Approach

1. **CSS Modules**
   - Component-specific styles
   - Scoped CSS classes
   - Global styles in `styles.css`

2. **Material-UI**
   - Theme customization
   - Component styling
   - Responsive design

## Key Features

### Internationalization

- Multi-language support using i18next
- Language detection
- Dynamic language switching
- Translation management

### Routing

- Client-side routing with React Router
- Protected routes
- Route-based code splitting

### API Integration

- Service-based architecture
- Axios for HTTP requests
- Error handling middleware
- Request/response interceptors

## Performance Considerations

1. **Code Splitting**
   - Route-based code splitting
   - Dynamic imports for large components

2. **Optimization**
   - React.memo for component memoization
   - useMemo and useCallback for performance optimization
   - Lazy loading of images and components

3. **Caching**
   - Browser caching
   - Service worker for offline support

## Security

1. **Authentication**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Secure token storage
   - Protected routes

2. **Data Protection**
   - Input sanitization
   - XSS prevention
   - CSRF protection

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Component testing
   - Hook testing
   - Utility function testing

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Feature testing
   - API integration testing

3. **E2E Tests**
   - User flow testing
   - Cross-browser testing

## Deployment

1. **Build Process**
   - Production build optimization
   - Asset compression
   - Source map generation

2. **CI/CD**
   - Automated testing
   - Build verification
   - Deployment pipeline

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**
   - Micro-frontend architecture
   - Module federation
   - State management scaling

2. **Maintenance**
   - Documentation updates
   - Dependency management
   - Performance monitoring
